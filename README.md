This application is a simulation of a physics experiment in which the acceleration is calculated when a block (made out of different materials) slides down a surface (made out of different materials) with the acceleration properly calculated through physics equations. The purpose of this application is to bring convenience to those who do not have access to labs and those who need a calculator for physics mechanics questions.
